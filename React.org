* React Basics
** React Components
- they are re-usable and independent pieces of React code that comprise the User Interface
** ES6 importing and exporting 
- a new syntax for sharing code between separate files
- used in cases like: =`import React from ‘react’`=
** State 
- the pertinent data to an application
- to declare add the constructor to a Component and declare its state object
** Updating State
- when updating state, make sure to never mutate state directly
- doing do will lead to fatal errors in your application
- instead re-declare new instances of state arrays or objects and use the =setState()= function to update state
** Props
- similar to state, except this data inherits from parent component specifying pieces of state as properties
** LifeCycle Methods
- events in React components that trigger in cases such as rendering on or off the screen or during state updates
- eg. the =componentDidMount()=
* Redux
- A JavaScript library which allows React applications to extract their data into one giant store
** Three steps to adding Redux
1) Define a redux contant
2) Add an action creator
3) Amend or add a reducer
** Redux Components
*** Constants
- constants that allow actions and reducers in redux to listen to the same type to ensure that it recogniyes true data
*** Action Creators
- methods that create and return actions for reducers to manipulate the redux store
*** Actions
- the plain JavaScript object that Action Creators return 
- most include a type parameter with a Redux constant and a certain data payload
*** Reducers
- extract the Redux logic for the store into functions that handle actions and return pieces of the state
*** Provider 
- a component at the root of your redux application that provides the redux store globally
*** mapDispatchToProps
- allows action creators to become accessible within Reac Components through this.props
*** mapStateToProps
- allows reducers in the redux store to become accessible within this.props in React Components through this.props
*** bindActionCreators
- a Redux method that allows action creators to store within this.props in React Components
*** Cookies
- string names that ap string values stored on the browser
- allows applications to keep a local history of data on a browser
